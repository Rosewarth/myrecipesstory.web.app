It&#39;s crisp with just the right amount of chewy dough, and it&#39;s the perfect size for a personal pizza. I put my own spin on naan by using sourdough to naturally leaven it. It takes longer for the dough to rise, but getting all the benefits from sourdough is totally worth the wait! Also, the tang from the sourdough plays well with the yogurt in the dough. Traditionally naan is cooked in a tandoor oven.
