recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water in mixing bowl. Set aside."
- "In another bowl combine flour, seasonings, and salt. Stir to combine."
- "Check mixing bowl and look for yeast to activate and form a foamy mound. If it doesn&#39;t within 10 minutes, your yeast may be dead and you&#39;ll need new yeast."
- "Add 1/4 cup oil to yeast mound, and then add dry ingredients mix. Attach dough hook to mixer. Mix at speed 1 for 30 seconds, then speed 2 for 2 minutes or until dough comes clean on sides of bowl."
- "Coat a new bowl with olive oil. Put dough in bowl and turn to coat lightly with oil. Cover with a dish towel and set in a warm place until doubled in size."
- "While dough is rising, preheat oven to 425°. Prep two jelly roll pans by covering with foil (makes for easier pizza removal and clean-up) and brush melted butter all over, ensuring you brush the sides well. Set pans aside."
- "Add all sauce ingredients to pressure cooker. Use your hands and &#34;squish&#34; the tomatoes to break them up. Set pressure cooker to hi 10 minutes and start."
- "While sauce is cooking, use a cheese grater to shred mozzarella blocks into piles of shredded cheese. Set aside."
- "Once dough has doubled in size (30-60 minutes), turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. (I use a kitchen scale to make it exact, but eyeball it best you can if you don&#39;t have one.)"
- "Roll one of the two dough balls out with a rolling pin near the size of your pan. Pick up and transfer to pan."
- "Using your hands, spread the dough out to the edges. Brush with olive oil and poke in various places with a fork to prevent bubbles forming during cooking. Repeat process with the other dough ball and other pan."
- "When sauce timer is done, quick release. Use a ladle to carefully transfer enough sauce to a blender to fill the blender *only* half full. On lowest speed *with lid on*, puree the sauce to make it smooth. (Repeat this step as necessary to make more puree as you go along, never starting the blender more than half full with the hot sauce.)"
- "Pour just enough sauce to cover dough onto one pan and spread evenly using the bottom of the ladle. Put in oven and set timer for 10 minutes."
- "Remove pan from oven, poke any bubbles that formed with a fork, and top with more sauce, spreading evenly again, and return to oven for 5 minutes."
- "Prep your second pan with sauce and have ready to go in the oven when the 1st comes out."
- "As soon as your pizza comes out of the oven, sprinkle with parmesan cheese."
- "Add a light coating of mozzarella."
- "Add your choice of toppings in a grid pattern and then top generously with more mozzarella. It is ready to cut and eat as soon as the cheese starts to melt."
- "Use the foil to lift the pizza out of the pan, onto the surface you&#39;ll cut the pizza on, and slide the foil out from under the pizza."
- "Cut the pizza so that each piece has the toppings in the middle."
- "Repeat process for second tray."
