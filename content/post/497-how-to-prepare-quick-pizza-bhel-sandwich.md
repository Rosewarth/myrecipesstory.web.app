The classic Indian street food from Bombay prepared with crispy noodles, onions, coriander I regularly order this Bhel because I Love it but, this time the Bhel was very dry, soggy. Check out our hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, Frostys and more! Restaurants near Diwana Bhel Poori House. Imagine my disappointment when we visited last Saturday only to find the bhel poori was a very poor standard, and the mushroom. The truth will set you free.
