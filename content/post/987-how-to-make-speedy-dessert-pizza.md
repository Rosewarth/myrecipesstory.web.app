##### Steps to make Dessert pizza:

1. I cheat and get the big bag of sugar cookies at Walmart and follow the directions on the bag. But I put a sugar cookie recipe on here as well.
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 12” non stick round pizza pan with non stick spray and set aside.
1. In a small bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda, set aside. -  In a large bowl cream together the butter and 1 cup of sugar, add the egg and vanilla and mix until creamy and combined.
1. Add the dry ingredients and mix until everything incorporated.
1. Press the cookie dough evenly in your greased pizza pan (make sure you flour your hands so they don’t stick to the cookie dough) and bake it for about 12 minutes or until lightly golden. Allow to cool completely.
1. In a large bowl, either using a spatula or a handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese, vanilla, confectioner sugar
1. Smear the cream cheese mixture evenly over the cooled cookie crust and top it with desired fruits. My favorite fruits for this is kiwi, berries and star fruit.
1. Cheaper way- I used Can pineapples Chunks, and mandarin oranges drained well and some strawberries, and cheated with a quick easy bake sugar cookies bag from Walmart.


For the crust, shape the cookie dough into a ball. Place the dough in the center of the White Large Round Stone or Rockcrok ® Grill Stone and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand. Chocolate Chip Dessert Pizza is, in my humble opinion, the best kind of pizza ever made. With a simple thin crust, a cream cheese based &#34;white pizza sauce&#34;, lots of chocolate, and a crumbly streusel topping, I think you can see why this is such a favorite of mine! Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture and beat well.
