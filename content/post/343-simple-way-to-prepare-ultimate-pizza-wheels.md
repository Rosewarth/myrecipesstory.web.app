recipeingredient:
- "1 can refrigerated pizza dough"
- "1 small jar pizza sauce"
- "1 cup pepperoni  chopped to 14in pieces we used a pepperoni stick we found at the store"
- "1 cup shredded mozzarella  chopped slightly for smaller pieces"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375°F. Generously spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. NOTE: I found my Pam with flour for baking works best with these."
- "Unroll Pizza dough sheet onto a clean, lightly floured surface, long side facing you (running left to right). Press dough out to make larger, about 12x8in. or so."
- "Spread a very thin layer of pizza sauce over surface, reserve the rest of jar for dipping. Next, sprinkle evenly with chopped pepperoni then shredded cheese."
- "Beginning with the edge closest to you (long side), tightly roll up dough into a log shape and position seam side down. Cut 12 slices about 1&#34; wide each. TIP: moisten your knife blade with water between each cut to prevent sticking."
- "Place pinwheels cut sides up &amp; down, about 2in apart on prepared baking sheet. Place in oven and bake 10 - 12 minutes, or until tops are bubbling and &#34;crust&#34; is lightly golden."
- "When done, remove pinwheels from oven, serve immediately with warmed pizza sauce and enjoy!"
- "NOTE: If you can&#39;t find a whole pepperoni stick to chop up, pre-diced will do. Or even pre-sliced will do, simply give the slices a rough chop and spread over sauce layer according to step 3. Although chopped pepperoni stick makes all the difference in my opinion. ;)"
