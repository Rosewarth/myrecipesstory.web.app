Warm water: There are no eggs or milk in pizza dough, just water!; Yeast: I tested both instant (rapid rise) and active dry yeast here. Instant yeast gave the best results, but active dry yeast does a decent job if that&#39;s all you have (it just may need a little more time to rise). Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative.
