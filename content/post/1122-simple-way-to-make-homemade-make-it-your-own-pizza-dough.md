- "Combine in a small or medium bowl your milk and lukewarm water. Add the liquid honey and stirr until dissolved."

You may also use a damp kitchen towel to cover the bowl as well. Put your bowl into a warm spot in your kitchen so your dough can rise for about an hour."
- "Once your dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead again on the counter to incorporate more flour. Return dough to the bowl, recover, and return to the warm spot in your kitchen to let rise again for 30 minutes."
- "For the 30 minutes, you can preheat your oven to 450°F and prepare your pizza toppings."
- "Once your dough has doubled in size again, punch down once more and return to the floured counter to work the dough into its final shapes and sizes. *If you wish, you can turn your dough into buns, mini pizzas, garlic sticks, or any other creation you&#39;d like to make."
- "Grease your baking pan or sheet with oil or spray. Place your dough onto the pan and work your dough to fit the pan and work into desired thickness. Place your sauce and toppings onto your dough and place into the oven on a middle rack."
- "Keep and eye on your creation, but after about 10-15 minutes your pizza should start to form a crust. At this time if you wish you can slide your pizza off the baking sheet onto your oven rack to get a crispier crust. Bake until toppings brown and bubble. (Another 5-15 minutes depending on size and doneness preference)"
- "To remove from oven, place back onto baking sheet before removing from the oven. Cut into slices and enjoy!!"
