Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, sourdough pizza. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Sourdough pizza is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look fantastic. Sourdough pizza is something which I have loved my whole life.

For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot, or double the yeast. For two thin-crust pizzas, divide the dough in half, and shape each into a flattened disk. A sensational sourdough pizza dough that comes together with minimal effort.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have sourdough pizza using 15 ingredients and 17 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough pizza:

1. Take  Dough
1. Take 250 g flour (type 00)
1. Get 25 g semolina
1. Take 1/2 tsp salt
1. Prepare 100 g sourdough starter
1. Prepare 160 ml water
1. Prepare 25 g olive oil
1. Prepare pinch dried yeast
1. Prepare  Toppings
1. Get 1 tin peeled tomatoes (pelati), 400 g (260 g net)
1. Take 1 tbsp oregano
1. Get 1 clove garlic, crushed
1. Get 1/4 tsp salt
1. Take 200 g buffalo mozarella
1. Take  anything else is optional, e.g. prosciutto, rocket, salami, mushrooms, basil


Lay your pizza dough on the floured/cornmealed pizza peel. Stretch and adjust the dough a little more, aiming to position one edge of the pizza all the way at the front edge of the peel. When you insert the peel into the oven, the front edge of the dough will &#34;catch&#34; on the hot stone, making it easier to slide the peel out from under the pizza. This is a varsity-level take on the classic pizza dough recipe from Roberta&#39;s in Brooklyn, using sourdough starter to help the dough rise â€” and give it great taste If you feed your starter regularly, you can use it in this recipe right out of the crock in which you store it But if not, give the starter a feed of flour and water a few hours before you mix up the dough Now your sourdough pizza dough is ready to rock and roll!
