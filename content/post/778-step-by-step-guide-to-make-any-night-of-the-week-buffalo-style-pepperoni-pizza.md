Y. (WKBW) — &#34;Cup and Char&#34; the mini greasy pepperoni found on Buffalo-style pizza. A prototype of the kind of Buffalo, New York-style &#34;cup-and-char&#34; pepperoni pies Baddpizza will serve when it opens in Falls Church later this year. (Photo: Baddpizza) Buffalo, New York native Joel Salamone isn&#39;t a big fan of the pizza around this area. It&#39;s got a lot of grease, as pepperoni should I guess, but you can microwave a handful of it between paper towels to get rid of most of the oil, then top your pizza and bake for a super crispy, comfortably spicy treat. Oh - and because of the name, I was concerned that it may be seasoned like Buffalo wings.
