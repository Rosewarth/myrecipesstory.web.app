This pizza recipe has been in the family for years. Originally, my mom would use the big homemade pitas for the crust, but When I got married I didn&#39;t have the big homemade pitas. Years ago it was very hard to find pita bread in a supermarket, I had to get them at the Middle-Eastern grocery stores. Kids will love this quick supper.

Experiment with different toppings such as sweetcorn and ham. Pizza only needs a few minutes to cook. In the Air Fryer and with Pita Bread, we need a lower temperature for a longer time to give the Pita a chance to warm up and not burn Air Fryers tend to cook quicker than ovens, I have found and different brands of Air Fryers cook different from each other. I realize that pizza made on pita bread is not a new concept. I&#39;m sure many of you have tried it.
