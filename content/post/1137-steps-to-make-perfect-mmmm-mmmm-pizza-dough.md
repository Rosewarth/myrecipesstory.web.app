Pizza &#34;Delivery was prompt, and the pizza was generously topped, with a perfectly crusty-yet-chewy crust and just the right amount of sauce. The dough was a tad on the bland side.&#34; Just a quick trip to one my favorite Pizza places. You will need to flour the counter to keep it from sticking. Put the rolled out dough on a baking sheet with baking paper, or even better, on a pizza stone. Spread the ricotta evenly on the dough, kind of like cream cheese. drizzle a good quality olive oil on top.
