recipeinstructions:

- "Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees (C)"
- "Take the olive oil and spread it on each dough and top it off with the bolognese tomato mix"
- "Add on the toppings: I used bacon and mushroom (you can add whatever you want)"
- "Add salt on top of the pizza toppings (I find that it flavours it more)"

- "Add it to the oven for 20-25 minutes, depending on the thickness of your base."
- "Remove from the oven. If you don&#39;t have a pizza cutter, do not attempt to cut the pizza straight from the oven because you&#39;ll just move the toppings around. Let it set first then cut it and serve."
