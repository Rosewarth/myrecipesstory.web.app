recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 6 / 200C / 400Â°F"
- "Make the pizza dough and bake as required before topping - see my recipe for details or use a store bought plain one and follow the directions on the pack.

- "You&#39;re best to pre-cook mushrooms and bacon first or else the juice / fat they release will make the pizza soggy - just a tiny splash of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and cook until they don&#39;t release any more liquid, then they&#39;ll be ready to use on your pizza. Don&#39;t worry about the mushrooms overcooking on the pizza. They aren&#39;t technically vegetables so the normal rules don&#39;t apply! Cook them until they&#39;re brown. Just undercook the bacon slightly though. If using spinach for instance to make a beautiful green eye, wilt it first in a pan, pat it dry then add to the pizza after it comes out of the oven so it doesn&#39;t overcook or make your pizza wet. I like to soften my pepper strips in the frying pan to make them flexible to shape for this too"
- "I like to spread garlic butter on top of the half cooked dough then on top of that tomato paste, pesto and grated cheese / cheese substitute. Add circles of mozzarella style cheese to make the whites of the &#39;eyes&#39;  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/357071-vickys-savoury-compound-butters-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-free"
- "Now add your &#39;iris&#39; on top of the cheese slices. I&#39;ve used sliced pepperoni but you can use anything you like. Chopped green pepper, spinach, sweetcorn..."
- "Add the olives or mushrooms for the &#39;pupil&#39;"
- "You can also do one big eyeball by piling the chopped mushrooms / olives right in the middle then the chopped bacon / pepperoni / vegetables around them. Add some thinly sliced red peppers and shape into yucky bloodvessels around the iris"
- "Now bake for 12 - 15 minutes or until the toppings are all cooked through and the base is crisp"
- "If making one big eyeball, serve as a whole pizza then at the table use a fork to distribute the piled topping evenly over the whole surface before slicing in front of everyone"
- "And it doesn&#39;t need to be scary for the kiddies either"
