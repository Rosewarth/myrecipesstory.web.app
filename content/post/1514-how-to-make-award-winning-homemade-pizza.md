Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch I decided to use naan bread for the pizza base. Using naan bread not only saves time but it is great for portion control. The only difference between this recipe and most pizza recipes is that It doesn&#39;t include a tomato sauce on the base. This recipe makes homemade pizza a simple dinner any night of the week.

I usually double it to make two big pizzas. The only thing I change is the cooking method. Beyond red pizza sauces, don&#39;t forget pesto sauces, white sauces, or even a simple olive oil and garlic sauce. They will expand your pizza potential by almost infinite proportions. Fresh and low-moisture mozzarella make for a winning combination.
