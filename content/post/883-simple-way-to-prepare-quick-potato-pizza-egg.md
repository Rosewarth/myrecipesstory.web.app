I can control where the eggs go about as easily as I can control what the kids choose to wear to school in the winter. Start layering the potato slices over the pizza dough in the pan, overlapping the slices slightly until all the dough is covered (unlike a traditional tomato pizza, you don&#39;t need to leave an edge of dough; I did so for the sake of the photos, or else the pizza would just look like slices of potatoes, but I&#39;d recommend going all the way to. I love versatility in any recipe, and this one is no different. Potato Crust Pizza is very easy to prepare, no need for preparing the dough in advance and it&#39;s also gluten-free.
