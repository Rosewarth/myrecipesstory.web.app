But if I&#39;m being honest, I rarely make pizza for my kids. I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery.

This sandwich is definitely worthy of one of those artisan breads too - the kind with the crusty exterior and chewy crumb - and I happened across a boule on the clearance rack of day old bread at the grocery store that was a great fit for this.
