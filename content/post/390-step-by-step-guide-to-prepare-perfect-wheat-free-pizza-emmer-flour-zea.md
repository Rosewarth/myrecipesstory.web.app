I think it was used (along with barley) in Egypt and the middle. Have thrown one out and started again and have made some adjustments to the measurements to accomodate the Emmer Wheat Flour (actually seems to need more water as the initial recipe seemed to have a very thick starter which was too thick to rise) so far I have been feeding and replenishing. Their flour is milled fresh to order. The farm has sent me samples during recipe testing, and I found the grains and flours splendid. Lentz Spelt Farms in Washington state has pioneered the growing of ancient wheats on the US market as well.
