Shockingly, something made primarily of flour and water isn&#39;t super exciting to the taste buds, and most of the flavor will come from whatever toppings you add. The dough: Because pizza dough is made from just a few common ingredients, the ratios of flour to water and yeast to salt make a big difference in the final dough. If you&#39;re making a rectangular pizza, shape the dough into a rough oval. For a round pizza, shape it into a rough circle. In either case, don&#39;t pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape.
