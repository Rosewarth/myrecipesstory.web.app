For proper Sicilian pizza dough, too much olive oil is NEVER an issue.</li>

<li>Repeat Step 4 two more times. Resting 10-15 minutes in between each time. Don't rush it! If you soak it, it will spread very easily.</li>
<li>Now the dough should be pretty much spread to the edges of the pan. Try to make the spread as even as possible, uniformly, otherwise you may have a huge crust bubbling up when you cook it. Now, take some more olive oil and again make the sign of the cross lengthwise horizontally and vertically on the dough, and then use your hands to spread it evenly all over the dough. Finally, using your fingers, punch fingerprint pits into the dough all over. This will aid in spreading the sauce easier.</li>
<li>Now it's time to add your sauce. Casa Visco is an absolutely awesome pizza sauce. The 32 oz. jar is only $3.99 and lasts for several pizzas. The sauce is also low fat, and cholesterol and gluten free. Using a tablespoon, drop 4 heaping tablespoons of the sauce onto the pizza. I find this is the proper amount for this dough. You can of course, by all means, use more.</li>
<li>Next, using the tablespoon, evenly spread the sauce on to the dough being sure to get as close to the edges as possible. I like to leave about a quarter inch edge of just plain dough all the way around the pizza that is not covered with sauce.</li>
<li>If you want to add other toppings besides the pepperoni and cheese, they should be placed on top of the sauce at this time. This is because the cheese protects the vegetables or other toppings that you put on, from burning in the oven because they are not directly exposed to the heat. For instance, I love broccoli on pizza. But it will burn if it is not covered by cheese.</li>
<li>Finally, add your mozzarella cheese or other preferred cheese at this time.and then because it's a 16-inch pizza, I use 32 slices of pepperoni. The grease from the pepperoni will soak into the dough while cooking sealing the deal for a true Sicilian pizza.</li>
<li>Pre-heat your oven to 475 degrees. And do not put your pizza in until it reaches that temperature. Cook the pizza for 10 to 12 minutes, and presto! You can now enjoy the fruits of your labor.</li>
