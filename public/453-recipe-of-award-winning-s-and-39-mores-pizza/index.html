<p>Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a special dish, s'mores pizza. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>S'mores Pizza is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It&rsquo;s easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful. S'mores Pizza is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook s'mores pizza using 14 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-s39mores-pizza">The ingredients needed to make S'mores Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 1 1/2 cups flour</li>
<li>Get 9 total cinnamon graham crackers</li>
<li>Take 1 cup sugar</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup melted butter</li>
<li>Make ready 1 egg</li>
<li>Take 2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp cream of tartar</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp honey (optional)</li>
<li>Get  Chocolate sauce</li>
<li>Prepare  Mini marshmallows</li>
<li>Take  Pizza pan with small holes</li>
</ol>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-s39mores-pizza">Instructions to make S'mores Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Start by crushing 6 graham crackers to almost dust. This should equal about 1 cup.</li>
<li>Mix the dry ingredients together. Graham crackers, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients. Butter, egg, vanilla extract, cream of tartar, and honey</li>
<li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix to a dough. You may need to add just tad bit of water to moisten it and have it all stick. Make sure to ball it up with your hand(s) to make sure everything gets attached.</li>
<li>Put the dough ball in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes so it toughens up. This will make it much easier to shape without going through the holed pizza pan.</li>
<li>Take dough ball out of refrigerator. Cover the holed pizza pan with wax paper and flatten dough out on the wax paper so it lays flat and is about 1/4&quot;-1/3&quot; thick all the way around and throughout the dough.</li>
<li>This will be the hardest part. Flip the dough upside down onto the holed pizza pan without completely destroying it. Some parts will come off, but just mend it all together without pushing down too hard.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Find a way to heat up the chocolate sauce so it spreads easily (I just microwave the jar). It's hard to say how much you need exactly, but spread enough so that the chocolate covers the crust with a thumb's width away the edge of the crust. (The rule of &quot;thumb&quot;!) I used a tablespoon to spread the sauce.</li>
<li>Sprinkle enough mini marshmallows onto the chocolate sauce so that they cover it enough without major gaps.</li>
<li>Drizzle a small amount of chocolate sauce across the marshmallows. (I was at the end of my container and had a hard time getting it out&hellip; Sorry!)</li>
<li>Crush the remaining 2 graham crackers and sprinkle across the top of the marshmallow/chocolate sauce toppings.</li>
<li>Bake the pizza for 20 minutes. Turn the pizza half-way around about half way if you need to bake it evenly.</li>
<li>Take out of oven and let sit for about 5 minutes. Then cut it how you'd like! I personally cut it into squares, but it's up to you. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
