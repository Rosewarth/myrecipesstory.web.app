<h5 id="steps-to-make-pizza-dip-with-toasted-garlic-baguettes">Steps to make Pizza Dip with Toasted Garlic Baguettes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>You can make the dip in the oven, I like to use a deep pie dish when I make it this way, or can be done in a crockpot, if I have time or if I am taking it to a pot luck or a bbq cook out. (oven at 350 for 20 mins or until the cheese melted and is a little brown, crockpot on high for about 2 hrs, till cheese melts)</li>
<li>Mix cream cheese and mozzarella cheese together.</li>
<li>Spread your softened cream cheese evenly across the bottom of your crock pot or pie dish</li>
<li>Pour your pizza sauce evenly on top of your cream cheese</li>
<li>Spread your pepperoni over top, reserving several to top your dish</li>
<li>Sprinkle on your onion, cheese and olives, or whatever toppings you are using (ending with the cheese)</li>
<li>Top with your remaining pepperoni</li>
<li>Meanwhile, prepare the baguettes, as the dip is cooking.</li>
<li>In a small bowl combine softened butter, olive oil, minced garlic, and salt &amp; pepper.</li>
<li>Place sliced baguettes on a nonstick baking pan and spread butter mixture evenly over each baguette.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
<li>When pizza dip comes out of the oven, turn the oven to broil and place the baguettes into the oven.</li>
<li>Broil the baguettes until golden. - Serve immediately with the hot pizza dip.</li>
<li>If you are making the dip in a crockpot, I’d just wait till it was done to make the baguettes, it doesn’t take long to make.</li>
<li>You can also sever this with Ritz Crackers, but it would also be good with pita chips or even breadsticks.</li>
<li>Another option is you can add some spices to the cream cheese, ½-1 teaspoon parsley - ½ teaspoon oregano - ¼ teaspoon basil - ¼ teaspoon garlic powder And a handful of cheese just mix all together in a bowl before putting it the crockpot or pie dish or adding some spices to the pizza sauce</li>
<li>There’s so many ways this can be made cheap or all out.</li>
<li>Notes- I use my favorite jar of spaghetti sauce and not pizza sauce, I also make my pizza monkey bread with this and spilt the spaghetti sauce for both recipe, one of the reasons I make them together.</li>
