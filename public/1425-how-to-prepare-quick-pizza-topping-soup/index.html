<p>Many people prefer to remain in the realm of tradition and convention. I really wanted soup, but thought I didn't have anything in the house to make some. The best way to avoid a pizza pitfall is pre-cooking your toppings. Here's how we look at it—treat Consider how each topping can enhance your pie, whether it's adding texture, flavor, or even a pop.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-pizza-topping-soup">Instructions to make Pizza Topping Soup:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mix the ingredients of the meatballs. Form into quarter, marble sized meatballs.</li>
<li>Scramble the loose meat ingredients and set aside use the drippings to fry the chicken in.</li>
<li>Slice the chicken into manageable pieces add them to the pan and beef drippings along with the dehydrated onions. Set aside when done.</li>
<li>Panfry the sausage. Let cook on the first side for 4 minutes. Turn and add the water and cover till the water evaporates.</li>
<li>When the water is evaporated remove from heat and slice the sausages.</li>
<li>Remove the casing from the salami and pepperoni. Slice them both leave the pepperoni slices whole. Mince the salami slices.</li>
<li>Drain the heart of palms. Where I come from here in central Florida, we usually call this swamp cabbage and cook it down with salt pork and simmer in milk. After you drain them slice them up and caramelize them a bit.</li>
<li>Chop the bacon and fry leave the drippings for the tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Add the tomato sauce and sauce ingredients to the bacon drippings.</li>
<li>Dice the tomatoes and add everything to the pot except the cheeses. Simmer 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Get the cheeses at room temperature. After the soup has simmered for 20 minutes let it rest covered for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Add cheeses to the bottom of your bowl. Add soup on top. Give it a stir. Serve I hope you enjoy!!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Mix the condensed soup and milk (use the empty soup can to measure your milk) and heat until warm; either in microwave or on the stove Stir and serve. Other favorite pizza toppings can be added too. Tomato sauce for topping homemade pizzas is an easy DIY. It's just three ingredients and a quick blitz in the blender.
