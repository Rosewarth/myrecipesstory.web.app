Hey everyone, it’s Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I’m gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, pepperoni pizza pasta bake. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I’m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.
Reminiscent of classic pepperoni pizza, this weeknight casserole is made with a mess of curly noodles in place of the doughy crust, just the right ratio of sauce to melted cheese, and thin slices of pepperoni that crisp up as they bake.">
