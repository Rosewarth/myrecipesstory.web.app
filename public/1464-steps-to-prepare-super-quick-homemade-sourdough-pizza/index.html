<p>Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a special dish, sourdough pizza. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Sourdough pizza is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Sourdough pizza is something which I have loved my whole life.</p>
<p>For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot, or double the yeast. For two thin-crust pizzas, divide the dough in half, and shape each into a flattened disk. A sensational sourdough pizza dough that comes together with minimal effort.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have sourdough pizza using 15 ingredients and 17 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-sourdough-pizza">The ingredients needed to make Sourdough pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  Dough</li>
<li>Take 250 g flour (type 00)</li>
<li>Get 25 g semolina</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Prepare 100 g sourdough starter</li>
<li>Prepare 160 ml water</li>
<li>Prepare 25 g olive oil</li>
<li>Prepare pinch dried yeast</li>
<li>Prepare  Toppings</li>
<li>Get 1 tin peeled tomatoes (pelati), 400 g (260 g net)</li>
<li>Take 1 tbsp oregano</li>
<li>Get 1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
<li>Get 1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>Take 200 g buffalo mozarella</li>
<li>Take  anything else is optional, e.g. prosciutto, rocket, salami, mushrooms, basil</li>
</ol>
<p>Lay your pizza dough on the floured/cornmealed pizza peel. Stretch and adjust the dough a little more, aiming to position one edge of the pizza all the way at the front edge of the peel. When you insert the peel into the oven, the front edge of the dough will &quot;catch&quot; on the hot stone, making it easier to slide the peel out from under the pizza. This is a varsity-level take on the classic pizza dough recipe from Roberta's in Brooklyn, using sourdough starter to help the dough rise — and give it great taste If you feed your starter regularly, you can use it in this recipe right out of the crock in which you store it But if not, give the starter a feed of flour and water a few hours before you mix up the dough Now your sourdough pizza dough is ready to rock and roll!</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-sourdough-pizza">Instructions to make Sourdough pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Place all the ingredients for the dough into a bowl and mix until just combined.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl, place it in the fridge, and let it ferment for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Lightly dust the counter top with a bit of flour and scoop the dough out on top of it.</li>
<li>Fold the dough into itself a few times until it starts to firm up a bit, then knock the air out of it by gently hitting it with your palm and pulling back with your fingers while slowly rotating the dough. Finally form a ball by tucking it in under itself while rotating.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 2 or 3 equal portions, depending on whether you want a slightly larger pizza or not.</li>
<li>Roll the portions into small balls by gently pressing down on them with your palm while doing a circular motion on a lightly dusted counter top. Dust your hands with a bit of flour if they are too sticky, but don't use too much.</li>
<li>Cover the dough portions with a kitchen cloth and let it prove for an hour to an hour and a half.</li>
<li>Place a roasting tray upside-down into the oven, and crank the oven up as far as it will go to preheat it.</li>
<li>While the dough is proving and oven pre-heating, prepare your toppings.</li>
<li>Pour the tomatoes out of the tin and into a bowl, and add the salt and garlic. Use your hands to squash them, then strain the excess liquid. You can save the tomato juice to drink it later.</li>
<li>Add the oregano to the tomatoes and mix.</li>
<li>Slice the mozzarella into rings, about half a centimetre thick. Chop and/or prepare any other toppings you might be using.</li>
<li>Dust a large cutting board with a mix of semolina and flour. Place one of the dough portions on the board. Be careful not to squash it all together, try to retain its natural shape while moving it to the board.</li>
<li>Stretch the dough with your fingers from the middle outwards, to form a pizza base, leaving a thicker edge on the outside. If you tear a hole in the dough, just patch it up with a bit of excess dough.</li>
<li>Spread half (or 1/3 depending on how many portions of dough you have) of the tomato sauce over the pizza base, space out the mozzarella slices, and add any of the additional toppings. Drizzle with a little bit of olive oil.</li>
<li>Slide the pizza from the cutting board onto the upside-down tray in the oven. Bake for about 5 minutes on full heat.</li>
<li>While the pizza is cooking, repeat steps 13-17 for the other pizza(s).</li>
</ol>
<p>How many crusts does this make? If you want a deep dish pizza, use all the dough for a single pizza and press it into an olive oiled pan. For regular sized thin crust pizzas, divide the dough in thirds. If you want a little thicker crust, divide in half. Sourdough Pizza Crust Dough Sourdough Pizza Crust Dough.</p>
