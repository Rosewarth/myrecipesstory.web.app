</figure></p>
<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Drew, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, honey jalepe√±o pizza. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>I was working on this in Pizza hut one day.and somehow (I don't remember how.it's been so long), the guy behind the counter said something to my little sister. If you don't have honey, just use sugar. The spicy jalapeno margarita is spicy spin on the classic margarita made with elderflower liqueur, honey, and fresh jalepe√±o.</p>
<p>Honey Jalepe√±o Pizza is one of the most well liked of current trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Honey Jalepe√±o Pizza is something which I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook honey jalepe√±o pizza using 9 ingredients and 16 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-honey-jalepe√±o-pizza">The ingredients needed to make Honey Jalepe√±o Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  Pizza dough (store bought or homemade) we used this recipe <a href="https://www.sugardishme.com/10-minute-pizza-dough/">https://www.sugardishme.com/10-minute-pizza-dough/</a></li>
<li>Get  Pizza sauce, as much or as little as you like (we made our own, but you can buy some pre-made in a jar too!)</li>
<li>Get 1 cup torn mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>Get 1 1/4 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
<li>Get 1 jalape√±o, sliced and de-seeded (leave seeds in for extra heat)</li>
<li>Prepare  Pepperoni slices, as much or as little as you like</li>
<li>Take 1 small handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>Take  Sriracha, for drizzling</li>
<li>Get  Honey, for drizzling</li>
</ol>
<p>All our pizzas are made using dough that is prepared fresh daily and our sauce that is made in house. (Tomato, black olives, jalepe√±o, red onions, cheddar cheese, tomato sauce and cheese). A fresh flour tortilla lightly fried till crisp. Topped with cinnamon sugar, honey, whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup. Pizza Shuttle Drop outside to get the &quot;(grease) halo&quot; (don't worry you wont lose a topping) and enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-honey-jalepe√±o-pizza">Instructions to make Honey Jalepe√±o Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F.</li>
<li>Start out by making your pizza dough by following the linked recipe to a T. If you are buying pre-made dough, skip this step! (NOTE: we recommend Trader Joes ‚Äúready to bake garlic and herb pizza dough‚Äù if you live near a Trader Joes! Any kind of pizza dough is just fine though.)</li>
<li>While your dough is rising for 10 minutes, pull off chunks of mozzarella from your mozzarella ball until you get about 1 cup‚Äôs worth and place them in a bowl.</li>
<li>Next, wash your jalape√±o, pat it dry with paper towel and place it on a cutting board. Cut your jalape√±o into slices and then de-seed them, using a toothpick to poke out the seeds.</li>
<li>Remove your fresh basil leaves from the stem and set them aside. Wash and pat them dry if you feel like being sanitary!</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt forget to get out your pepperoni and shredded cheese as well!</li>
<li>After 10-ish minutes have passed, sprinkle some flour down on a clean surface and place your dough ball on the counter. Grab a rolling pin and roll out that dough! (NOTE: We rolled ours out to be about ~1/8-1/4‚Ä≥ thin‚Ä¶ so pretty thin. We found that this was the perfect thickness after it was done. It will rise quite a bit, so don‚Äôt make it too thick!)</li>
<li>Place your dough on a greased pizza stone or cast iron pizza pan. (NOTE: If you don‚Äôt have a pizza stone or pan, use the back side of a sheet pan! Don‚Äôt forget to spray it with non-stick spray. If you need to shape your pizza to be a little more square, go for it!)</li>
<li>Next, season your crust! (NOTE: We recommend basting it with melted butter or olive oil mixed with garlic powder and Italian seasoning. If you‚Äôre using freshly-pressed garlic cloves, don‚Äôt overdo it because it has a strong flavor!)</li>
<li>Now start spooning your pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it around. Add as much or as little as you like.</li>
<li>Then add your shredded Italian cheese blend, evenly distributing</li>
<li>Add the pepperoni next. Again, add as much or as little as you like. Then add the jalape√±o slices, then the mozzarella chunks and then finally the basil leaves.</li>
<li>Place your pizza in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes, Take your pizza out and see if it‚Äôs cooked to your liking. We ended up putting ours back in for 2 more minutes!</li>
<li>When you‚Äôre happy with your pizza‚Äôs done-ness, finish it off with a drizzle of Sriracha across the top, followed by a drizzle of honey.</li>
<li>Enjoy!! üôÇ</li>
