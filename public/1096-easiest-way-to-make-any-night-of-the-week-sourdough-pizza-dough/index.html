<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have sourdough pizza dough using 5 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-sourdough-pizza-dough">The ingredients needed to make Sourdough pizza dough:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 75 grams sourdough</li>
<li>Make ready 250 grams warm water</li>
<li>Prepare 325 grams bread flour</li>
<li>Get 8 grams salt</li>
<li>Take  olive oil</li>
</ol>
<p>Given supply constraints, I didn't get creative with the flour mix here. Place your shaped pizza dough onto the floured peel or baking sheet. Scatter half of the mozzarella and the Parmesan on top. Sourdough Pizza Dough Kat Craddock Adapted from the Basic Country Bread recipe in Chad Robertson's book Tartine Bread, this mild sourdough makes an excellent pizza.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-sourdough-pizza-dough">Instructions to make Sourdough pizza dough:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Yields 2 30cm pizzas</li>
<li>Refresh your sourdough with 150 grams of warm water and 150 grams of bread flour, mix thoroughly Lett rest for 12 hours</li>
<li>After the dough has rest for 12 hours at the remaining water and mix throughly</li>
<li>Add the remaining flour and salt</li>
<li>Knead until you obtain a smooth but strong dough</li>
<li>Divide the dough into two parts and put them in lightly oiled bowls, and let rest for 30 minutes</li>
<li>stretched in a floured board, cover with topings of your choice and bake at 250 ° C for 15 to 20 minutes</li>
</ol>
<p>Stir until well mixed, and forms a rough, sticky dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured counter. On a floured surface, push and stretch a ball of dough into a circle roughly the same size as the pan. Get the pan very hot, then working quickly and carefully, drape it into the pan, spread over some of the sauce, a handful of mozzarella and some basil, if using.
