<li>Next is we cook the beef. In a pan over heat, cook the beef with a cup of water. Let it simmer. Wait until there's no more water.</li>
<li>Sauté the ground beef and garlic and onion. When cooked, set aside.</li>
<li>After 2 hours from setting aside, the doughs should look like it increased in size. Use one dough if you're making inmy one pizza and keep the other one in the ref for later use. Knead it with your hands. Roll it. Dust your working area with flour to precent the dough from sticking.</li>
<li>Lay the dough flat in your working area. Make a ridge on the outsides about half an inch and continue pushing with your fingers or knuckles from the center of the dough outwards. The dough should be more flat and bigger by this time.</li>
<li>The dough should be about 7in by this time. Close your fist and put the center of the dough on it. With both your fists, rotate the dough repeatedly. This stretches the dough. Stop until it's stretched and about 9in.</li>
<li>Lay the stretch dough flat again in your working area or a 9in pan. Get the sauce you prepared and spread it across with the back of a spoon.</li>
<li>You may now scatter slices of cheese, or grated cheese, whichever you want, followed by the ground beef, bacon, sliced hotdogs, onions and bell peppers.</li>
<li>On my pizza, i sandwiched the toppings between layers of cheese.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 475°F for about 10-15mins. Put the pizza in and bake for about 20mins.</li>
<li>Once 20mins is done. Turn off the oven but leave the pizza for another 5-10mins.</li>
<li>The pizza is now ready!</li>
