<p>The newest pizza place on the beach also happens to be one of the best in Perdido Key. Paul's Pizza Company has beachgoers and locals alike talking about their host of fresh toppings, perfectly prepared sauce, and handmade pizza dough. Pizza Burger: Extra Ground Beef, Green Pepper And Onion Taco Pizza: Thin Crust, Taco Beef, Mozzarella And Cheddar Cheese, Onion, Jalapeño, Topped with Lettuce and Tomato The Chicken Spinach Alfredo.</p>
