<li>Using a potato masher, 30 minutes into simmer, gently mash your tomatoes and onions whereby creating more of a chunky puree.</li>
<li>In the last 15 minutes of your simmer, add your 6 chopped basil leaves. Reserve more whole leaves for pizza garnish finish. I also mash my red sauce once more at this point and add anything else my sauce may need. During long simmer times - flavors can easily dissipate. So, I'll usually add additional sea salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to steep quickly in my sauce. It's up to you!</li>
<li>Allow sauce to cool before placing it on your pizzas. This sauce recipe equals four cooked cups.</li>
<li>° 45 minutes prior to baking your pizzas, heat oven and pizza stone to 500°. Later, turn oven down to 425°. Dust pizza stone with corn meal or, you can place your raw dough on parchment, then place it on your pizza stone.                                                   ° Bake about 5 - 7 minutes or, until crust is browned and slightly firm.                                                                                                                                         ° Allow crust to cool a bit before constructing pizzas. Remember, these pizza crusts go back in the oven to bake again once topped. This easy technique ensures you won't have raw dough in the center of your pizzas.</li>
<li>If using a pre-fabed pie crust such as Mama Mary's or Boboli, lightly brush the outer edges with olive oil and bake for 5-7 minutes until crust is slightly browned and crispy.</li>
<li>° Ladle your sauce on your crust stopping about a 1/2&quot; from the edges.                                                                        ° Slice your Motzerella thin or, break it up and position it how you'd like on your pizza. Add fresh basil.                                                                                                                                                                      ° Bake pizza as per manufactures directions or, until all cheeses are melted and your outer crusts are visually crispy.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
