<p>Hey everyone, hope you&rsquo;re having an amazing day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a distinctive dish, vegetarian pizza. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Whole Wheat Veggie Pizza A wonderful crust layered with herbed tomato sauce and toppings encourages my family of six to dig right in to this low-fat main course. —Denise. Vegetarian &quot;sausage&quot; is a flavorful pizza topping, especially when paired with artichokes and a drizzle of pesto. The recipe calls for vegan cheese but that can be swapped out for dairy cheese if desired.</p>
<p>Vegetarian Pizza is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. Vegetarian Pizza is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook vegetarian pizza using 9 ingredients and 15 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-vegetarian-pizza">The ingredients needed to make Vegetarian Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Get 2 tsp *Yeast</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tsp Sugar</li>
<li>Get 1 *Salt</li>
<li>Take 1 *Warm water as required</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tsp Olive Oil</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tsp Butter</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Mozerrella Cheese</li>
<li>Get 1 Vegetable toppings of your choice</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it's not in the recipe title, we're loving that this white pizza from Half Baked Harvest has ultra-thin slices of delicata squash as a base. Papa John's believes pizza is for everyone, including those with a vegan diet! Better ingredients, Better pizza, and better options for those that prefer an animal product-free pizza. This vegetarian pizza is super-quick to make because the base is yeast free.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-vegetarian-pizza">Instructions to make Vegetarian Pizza:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mix the all purpose flour,  yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Add warm water slowly and mix the flour mixture until it becomes a solid  ball. Take care to mix it using the blunt side of a knife or a spatula in a cutting motion. Once the dough has come together in the bowl, put it on a slightly floured area and knead it for about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Grease a large bowl with Olive oil and place the dough in it. Cover it with a wet kitchen towel or cling wrap and keep it in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or till the dough has doubled in size.</li>
<li>Once the dough has doubled in size,  punch it down so as to let out all the air  and knead it again on a slightly floured surface for about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Once kneaded, the dough is ready and you can either make pizza right away or save it for later by wrapping it in a cling wrap and  placing it in the fridge.</li>
<li>Using your hands, flatten the dough into a circle. Stretch it from one side while continously turning the dough in one direction. In this way you can increase the diameter of the pizza base.</li>
<li>Once it forms around 8 inches in diameter you can use your knuckles to stretch the outer portion because by this time the centre would have become thin compared to the outer portion.You can also use a rolling pin to  roll the dough until you reach the desired shape and thickness.</li>
<li>You can add any topping of your choice.  I have used basil paste,  tomato ketchup, onion rings and some olives.</li>
<li>Apply some butter on the dough and some basil paste over it.</li>
<li>Squeeze some Tomato ketchup over the basil paste and add the Onions and olives uniformly over the dough. You can also put some shredded mozerella cheese over the top.</li>
<li>Pre-heat the oven to 200°F Celsius.  Place the prepared dough in it and bake it for about 10 - 15 minutes or until the sides starts to turn brown.</li>
<li>There you have a yummy vegetarian Pizza all for yourself. Enjoy it and let me know if you liked it.</li>
<li>*Yeast - I have used instant dried yeast. So there was no need for me to dissolve it in water beforehand. I could straightaway use it in the flour mixture as given in the recipe.</li>
<li>*Salt- I have used 1-2 teaspoon cooking salt. Make sure you don't use salt that says 'Anti caking agent' as it might affect the baking process.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Warm water- The water has to be warm at around 43 degree celsius and not boiling.  The temperature is only indicative to show that the water must not be too hot as hot/boiling water will hinder the fermentation by yeast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Carine used a thin sprouted pizza base and topped it with fried black beans, red onions, grilled corn, salsa sauce, and coconut yogurt. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients; stir in yeast mixture. I have not had success at creating a good vegan pizza yet but from looking at this, there is hope. In the past with dairy pizzas, I have used wheat berries and ground the whole wheat flour right before using. Arrange eggplant, zucchini, and squash slices alternately over cheese.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up with this special food vegetarian pizza recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I&rsquo;m sure that you can make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
